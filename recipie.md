## HOW TO PREPARE IT ##

* Bring water to a boil in a large pot and add salt, oil.
* When the water begin to boil rapidly, then add pasta and cook al dente.
* Drain to a colander.
* Heat oil in a pan and saute garlic and chili flakes slightly.
* Add onions if using and cook until golden. Add tomato puree and cook until thick.
* Add oregano, sugar, salt and pepper.
* Saute for a min.
* When the sauce turns thick enough add veggies and pasta.
* Mix well. If pasta looks too dry add 1 to 2 tbsp of pasta cooked water or olive oil. Oil tastes better.
* Serve vegetable pasta in red sauce hot or warm.
